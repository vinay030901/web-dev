<!-- 
Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.

Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".

The following example selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements:

Example
div + p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

it select the element directly after the given element.
for example:
it select all the siblings, means her in example 
Div ~ p{background-color:red;}
So, when div is initialised, now whenever p will come, it will be affected.

<p>The general sibling selector (~) selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.</p>
