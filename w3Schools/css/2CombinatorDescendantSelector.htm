<!-- A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

descendant selector (space)
child selector (>)
adjacent sibling selector (+)
general sibling selector (~)

Descendant Selector
The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements: 

Example
div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
denoted by space( ),
For example: div p{color:red;}
So, all the p elements in div will be coloured red here.
One thing to notice is, if we have a condition like
<div>
<p>bro</p>
<section><p>hello</p></section>
</div>
Then also p will be coloured red, because p is descendant of div
Answer of above queury:
Bro
hello
