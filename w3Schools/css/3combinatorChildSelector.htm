<!-- 
    Child Selector (>)
The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements that are children of a <div> element:

Example
div > p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

b.	Child selector: denoted by greater than sign(>)
In this selector, all the child will be selected, one thing to notice is we are talking about the child and not descendants, means we are talking about direct descendants.
For example:
div>p{color:red;} 
<div>
<p>bro</p>
<section><p>hello</p></section>
</div>
Answer of above query: 
Bro
Hello
